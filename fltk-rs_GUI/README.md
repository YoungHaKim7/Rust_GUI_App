- Speed. Fast to install, fast to build, fast at startup and fast at runtime. 
- Single executable. No DLLs to deploy.
- Supports old architectures. 
- FLTK's permissive license which allows static linking for closed-source applications.
- Themeability (5 supported schemes: Base, GTK, Plastic, Gleam and Oxy), and additional theming using [fltk-theme](https://crates.io/crates/fltk-theme).
- Provides around 80 customizable widgets. 
- Has inbuilt image support.
