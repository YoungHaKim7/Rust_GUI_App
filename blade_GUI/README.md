- Blade is an innovative rendering solution for Rust. It starts with a lean low-level GPU abstraction focused at ergonomics and fun. It then grows into a high-level rendering library that utilizes hardware ray-tracing. Finally, a task-parallel asset pipeline together with egui support turn it into a minimal rendering engine.
